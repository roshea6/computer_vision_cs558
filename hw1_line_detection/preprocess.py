"""
	Description: Part 1 of hw1, preprocess the image by detecting potential points on the lines.
	Apply a Gaussian filter first and use the Sobel filters as derivative operators.
	Threshold the determinant of the Hessian and then apply non-maximum suppression in 3 Ã— 3
	neighborhoods. Ignore pixels for which any of the filters falls even partially out of the image
	boundaries.
